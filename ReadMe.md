I was working through the book
"Containerize your Apps with Docker and Kubernetes" by Gabriel N. Schenker (Packt 2018)
(version Distributed free by Microsoft)
when, reaching chapter 3, I came across an example that did not work.  No fault of the author; he had relied on a random quote server that had been taken off line.

Still, I wanted to work through the example.  "Hey," I thought, "I can serve my own quotes using another docker container."

And, this turned out to be true.

One shell script, `refresh.sh`, refreshes and starts the server in question

The other shell script, `client.sh`, asks it for a random quote.

This works on Docker Desktop for the MacOS YMMV

The "quotes" are statistics glossary terms extracted from the book Think Stats 2, Second Edition by Allen B Downey, which you can download, read, and even purchase
