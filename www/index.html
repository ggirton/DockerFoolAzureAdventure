    <p>I was reading an independent developer's <sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> description of how he had adopted the techniques of Scrum in his solo practice.</p>
<h1 id="scrum-of-one">Scrum of One, the movie</h1>
<p>You've seen the T-shirt, Army of One. It got me to wonder, could you make your own movie: Scrum of One?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Army of One&quot; was the slogan of a U.S. Army recruiting campaign design by Chicago-based ad agency Leo Burnett, in 2001. Criticized because of its apparent de-emphasis on teamwork, it was replaced in 2006 by &quot;Army Strong&quot;. &quot;Army Strong&quot; was developed by McCann Worldgroup, under a 5-year $1 billion contract. Under Leo Burnett, the first year of the annually-renewable contract was budgeted for a spend of $150 million.</p>
</blockquote>

</figure>
<p>&quot;Scrum Strong&quot; would be a better slogan, since Scrum is usually 7 plus or minus 2 developers (5 to 9 people), and the official Scrum Guide notes that smaller teams may &quot;encounter skill constraints&quot; during a sprint, which make them &quot;unable to deliver a potentially releasable increment&quot;.</p>
<p>Further, &quot;Fewer than three Development Team members decrease interaction and results in smaller productivity gains. &quot;</p>
<p>The other problem is a bit more subtle. The idea of arbitrary numerical scoring is not supported in Scrum.</p>
<p>Scrum is connected to reality, and one of the ways you can connect is via parts-of-a-day units of time. In other words you estimate on the basis of actual units of time expended. To use arbitrary numbers as a proxy for the actual numbers would, I think, be regarded as not part of Scrum (although not necessarily invalid).</p>
<p>Since you are just one person, if you are enamored of the idea of Scrum, the implication is that instead of attempting &quot;Scrum of 1&quot;, you should aim to increase your team someday in order to add skills you don't have.</p>
<p>In the meantime, let's assume you want to get started right now, and that you will make sure to learn this lesson as you proceed. Your long term objective can be &quot;Scrum Strong.&quot; Since you are bootstrapping yourself, teaching yourself &quot;Scrum of One&quot; is onboarding yourself to your own one-person team.</p>
<p>You have to make up your own procedures. Here are some ideas:</p>
<p>Hole up at the Bernardus Lodge in Carmel Valley for a week, and read a couple of books about Scrum.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;The lodge is an adobe style village with the pool, croquet lawn, spa, and reception at its centre. The ample guest rooms are luxuriously provided with every comfort and amenity&quot;.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another possibility: save time by reading, on a single beach walk, just one 54 page book: &quot;Scrum: a Breathtakingly Brief and Agile Introduction&quot; by Chris Sims and Hillary Johnson.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Only a veteran of Hollywood’s singularly bitchy madness could write a book as weirdly, crazily, wickedly awesome as this&quot;.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, it was actually a different book, but by then I had saved even more time by reading all 18 pages of The Scrum Guide (tm), by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>After all, why not go right to the source? I didn't have to spend any money or even leave my living room, although croquet would have been fun.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, here is what I came up with:</p>
<h2 id="its-all-about-this-sprint.">It's all about THIS SPRINT.</h2>
<p>Here are the principles to test for this particular sprint, which will be for the remainder of this month:</p>
<h2 id="ship-or-share">Ship (or Share)</h2>
<p>You must get what you are doing in front of someone who will give you a reality check. This is the pragmatic rationale behind Scrum: a non-cybernetic feedback loop. If you read the Scrum Guide, you will see that this idea is entirely implied.</p>
<h2 id="quantify">Quantify</h2>
<p>A watchword of some agile processes, is to quantify your productivity using points? In order to be Scrum, it's not that simple.</p>
<p>To some people, this IS the heart of Scrum, to establish and keep track by assigning points to stories.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I got re-interested in Scrum not too long ago, when I heard developers in a software study group talk back and forth about how many &quot;points&quot; they would assign to different dev scenarios, which they called &quot;stories&quot;.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To start with, I might say that I'm going to use only prime numbers below 10, since it is a rough and ready system anyway: 1 2 3 5 7. Maybe a reduced range would help establish consistency?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In actual fact, the Scrum guide says nothing about assigning arbitrary point values. For the developers in the scrum team, it is supposed to be self organising, so you could definitely do that if you want.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A better way to estimate is to think, &quot;how much time will it take to do this?&quot; Then, you have a chance to think concretely, and get better at concrete thinking by attempting it in the first place.</p>
<p>If you absolutely have to use the prime numbers below 8, you should at least give a shot to the idea of mapping them to the available hours of the day you're Scrummin' on.</p>
<p>The numbers you DO come up with are used to A) estimate how you think something will take, B) decide between items what to do next, C) See how well you did, and then eventually D) Plan better the next time. Each sprint should have roughly the same number of &quot;points&quot;.</p>
<p>Reflect on what went well, and what did not. Do this each day (obviously if you are making videos), and at the end of a sprint.</p>
<p>Here are the durations of all the things in your scrum.</p>
<h2 id="durations">Durations</h2>
<p>Sprint durations: 1 to 4 weeks. (1 month max).</p>
<h3 id="daily-scrum-6-minutes-every-morning">Daily scrum (6 minutes every morning):</h3>
<p>Here is what you would do for your daily scrum if you were indie developer Alex Andrews. He actually does this, and it works for him.</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch the 45-to-60 second video that you recorded yesterday</li>
<li>If there were a name for this video, it would be called: &quot;Yesterday/Today&quot;</li>
<li>Ask and answer the Question: here is what I said I would do. Did I do it?</li>
<li>Then, you make another video to review tomorrow.</li>
<li>You only rehearse the video for two minutes.</li>
<li>You say &quot;Here is what I will do before tomorrow.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are obsessed by video, you might do all this. But actually, the two principles of <strong>openness</strong> and <strong>reflection</strong> are what govern your meeting. The name of the video is a good one: Yesterday/Today/Impediments.</p>
<p>The additional term &quot;impediment&quot; is a shorthand for the question: Is there any impediment that prevents me from reaching my objective?</p>
<h3 id="revise-plan-each-day">Revise plan (each day)</h3>
<p>Tweak the points, add/remove tasks</p>
<h3 id="story-time-29-44-mins-every-week">Story time (29-44 mins every week):</h3>
<p>This is not really part of Scrum, but you can make it part of Scrum of One if you want.</p>
<ul>
<li>be the CEO role,</li>
<li>deep thinking, new ideas,<br /></li>
<li>maintain your scrum backlog list</li>
</ul>
<p>Do story time in a separate location: porch out front, basement, or even beach (yay!)</p>
<h3 id="sprint-release-done-on-the-sked-you-devise">Sprint release (done on the sked you devise),</h3>
<p>Release even if you have to reduce scope. Get that feedback on sked!</p>
<h3 id="last-day-of-the-sprint-tasks-up-to-two-hours-each">Last day of the sprint tasks (up to two hours each):</h3>
<h4 id="retrospective.">Retrospective.</h4>
<p>Identify:</p>
<ul>
<li>One thing to make you more productive</li>
<li>One thing to make you happier</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="make-a-plan-for-the-next-sprint-2-hour">Make a plan for the next Sprint (2 hour)</h4>
<p>You will have a product backlog to serve as the basis for the plan.</p>
<p>Do it using the points.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-organized-with-a-kanban-board">Keeping organized with a Kanban board</h2>
<p>This is not really part of scrum either, this is more like Kanban.</p>
<p>Progress board: todo, doing, done This is your Kanban board You might use Trello board for this</p>
<p>When you are done with your Sprint?</p>
<ul>
<li>Celebrate 🍸</li>
<li>Rest 🏖</li>
<li>Explore 🏝</li>
</ul>
<p>That's the basic outline, next time I will talk about reducing the number of tools involved to the bare minimum: one.</p>
